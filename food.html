Each slice is dipped into beaten eggs, seasoned with salt, and other condiments according to the cook's taste (such as parsley and garlic). Each slice is then dipped in bread crumbs (or occasionally flour) and shallow-fried in oil, one at a time. Some people prefer to use very little oil and then bake them in the oven as a healthier alternative.
